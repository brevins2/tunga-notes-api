feature to allow contribution and commenting on the notes by
non authors on the app.
Posts on that users can pick and research about some notes like
one user can post asking if somene can make some notes about some
specific notes.
A feature maybe that can allow authors to post video or audio or both 
for users with respective disabilities or even users with bais on reading
and prefer hearing or watching.
A restictions on some specific notes as prefered by the user could as well be great
for the app, which gives the authors a chance to determine when to release
the notes and when to pull it down or even store it un viewed by specific people
or by only the author.
